# MICB 475 Meeting Agenda

## Action Items

- [ ] Decide on which dataset to upload to the server - Ryan or Halfvarson
- [ ] Contact Anti-TNF paper authors to get metadata
- [ ] Decide on a research question
- [ ] Start thinking about research objectives and aims

## Biological Questions

### Pathobionts Investigation

- Can we investigate pathobionts in the Ryan or Halfvarson dataset?
- Is it feasible to integrate metabolomic data from other datasets to expand on the concept of pathobionts and their role in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?

### Biogeography in IBD

- Upon a quick review of the Ryan paper, assess the feasibility of developing a biogeography question related to IBD.
