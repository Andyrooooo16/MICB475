## Points of Discussion

- [ ] [Meeting 5 Figures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OCKwRm5xAVuu77s79gBx3sdyREO051V91ngdQTUaMPs/edit#slide=id.p)
- [ ] Aim 1 is finished!
- [ ] Aim 2 is also 85% done
- [ ] ISA bubble plot with RA - what's the best way to show this data
- [ ] Core microbiome progress
- [ ] Inflammation parameter

## Meeting Notes

### Chao1 vs. Shannon
- more papers use Shannon
- Shannon considers more parameters than Chao1
- group agrees on doing Shannon
- cautious with phrasing

### CD location
- ileocolonic worst type of CD --> spans both ileum and colon
- add healthy control --> for stats: compare everything to HC 

### Plots
- however we decide to order things (i.e. low/medium/high), keep it consistent between plots

### ISA plot
- filter by stats (Avril recommends above 0.8/0.9)
- create bubble plot: requires some data wrangling (need to calculate relative abundance ourself, take average abundance for each group and species) (should be able to do in 2 lines of code) (use geom point) (use groupby and summarize functions)
- after narrowing down ISA (10-15 taxa), identify which are associated with CD/inflammation, etc.
- steps: calculate abundance, psmelt, groupby, summarize, look into species
- after groupby and summarize, will have mean abundance for each group

### Goals for next week
- finish analysis
- have figures cleaned up and ready to go for presentation (make sure figures are consistent with required formatting, see rubric --> find in assessments)
- go with stars instead of p-values in figures
- review data in next meeting
