# Meeting notes 2024/04/04

**Slide Deck for Presentation**: 
- *Slide 1:* Title Should be conclusion of our study
- *Slide 3:* On "Research Gap" visual, tell a story. Make a schematic explaining surgical resection & inflammation/fecal calprotectin
- *Slide 5:* Change slide title to: "RESULT: As disease severity increases, diversity is further reduced." Do pairwise analysis, not global p-value. Put p-values only on the ones that are significant
- *Slide 6:* Change slide title to: "RESULT: Surgery significantly reduces the diversity of Crohn’s disease patients with no inflammation compared to healthy controls." Be careful with words that imply causation, especially in manuscript. Address causation as a limitation
- Discussion points: Inflammation individuals tend to have taxa that are more resilient → thus if we change environment, those may remain
No inflammation tend to have more vulnerable taxa Do Kruskal Wallis then Tukey Post Hoc. Can group and do comparison: group A (HC & no inflammation no surgery) is significantly different from group B (the rest)



- *Slide 7:*
