Meeting notes

	- Order x-labels (from low to high)
	- Consistent across metrics in terms of alpha diversity
	- Potential explain trends even if p-value isn’t significant (ideally if p-value is close to significant)
		○ Clearly state non-significant data if going onto expalin trends
	- Pair wise comparisons b/w two key groups 
		○ Inflammation groups w/ and w/o surgery
		○ Surgery w/ and w/o inflammation
	- Calprotectin vs. Disease severity
		○ Switch calprotectin to inflammation
	- Create a new metadata column with disease severity and presence or absence of inflammation
		○ Can either do in excel
		○ Or before phyloseq object in R
	- Red for inflammation 
	- Blue for no inflammation 
	- Strongest colour for high disease severity
	- Relative abundance:
		○ Group smaller phyla together (<1%)
			§ Follow up email on how to do this
	- Taxa bar plot:
		○ Note observations for paper (correlation not causation)
	- Indicator species: 
		○ Avril will try and update us 
	- Core microbiome
		○ Only include taxa from indicator species (key species) and find where they are using cd_locaiton
		○ Make sure to explain in manuscript how this aim connects to other aims.

	- Remove failed samples from phyloseq
		○ Mention why they were removed in manuscript
