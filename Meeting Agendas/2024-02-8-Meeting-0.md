## Biological Questions

### Pathobionts Investigation

- Can we investigate pathobionts in the Ryan or Halfvarson dataset?
- Is it feasible to integrate metabolomic data from other datasets to expand on the concept of pathobionts and their role in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?

### Biogeography in IBD

- After a quick review of the Ryan paper, can we develop a biogeography question related to IBD?
