# Meeting Agenda 2024/02/23

- **Sequencing read cutoff**: leave at 99 bp for now if we have good annotations (few NAs), then we may want to go back later and cut at 91 bp (make sure to specify why our cutoff is so unique)
    - [ ] For the proposal, use the pre-trained classifier. May need to train classifier later for sequencing length
        
-	**Classifier**: used to identify taxonomy for OTUs

-	**Inflammation**: introduce fecal calprotectin early in intro
    - [ ] Discuss the downstream significance of inflammation: does it indicate an active flare up? Active disease? Does it have the potential to predict disease status?

-	**CD_location**: 1 = ileal (small intestine); 2 = colon; 3 = mixed (use Venn diagram for species of interest/indicator species)

-	**Aims**: write 3 minimum, can combine our current aims 5-7 into one aim

-	**Core microbiome**: is there a disease location where a specific taxa is more abundant/prevalent?

-	**Research question**: need one overarching question (be cautious with wording, don’t imply causation) and provide rationale/justification (i.e. How does inflammation modify observed… OR Does inflammation alter the observed microbial composition in CD patients with or without resection?)

-	**Approach**: ensure the approach has enough details, cite original QIIME paper, be specific and clearly write out each step. State whether we are using R vs. QIIME2
