# Meeting Notes 2024/02/29
- Cutoff at 100000 for sampling depth is still very large
- Set cutoff to 124392 for analysis
- Timeline: divide work now and get started ASAP --> things will take longer than expected
- Assign ~2 people/task
- Aim 2: can we make a heatmap for prevalent/indicator species?
- Start with indicator species analysis --> calculate relative abundance --> make dot plot/heatmap
- Goals for next week: get started on aims 1 & 2
- Core microbiome suggestion: run on bacteria of interest from aim 2 (generate vector with taxa of interest, filter out phyloseq using vector, determine core microbiome)
- Have 2 people working on alpha/beta diversity
- Analyze data as you go, don't wait till the end
