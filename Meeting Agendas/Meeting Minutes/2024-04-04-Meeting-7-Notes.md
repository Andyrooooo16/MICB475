# Meeting notes 2024/04/04

**Slide Deck for Presentation**: 
*Slide 1:* Title Should be conclusion of our study
*Slide 3:* On "Research Gap" visual, tell a story. Make a schematic explaining surgical resection & inflammation/fecal calprotectin
*Slide 5:* Change slide title to: "RESULT: As disease severity increases, diversity is further reduced."
- Do pairwise analysis, not global p-value.
- Put p-values only on the ones that are significant
*Slide 6:* Change slide title to: "RESULT: Surgery significantly reduces the diversity of Crohn’s disease patients with no inflammation compared to healthy controls." 
- Be careful with words that imply causation, especially in manuscript. Address causation as a limitation
- Inflammation individuals tend to have taxa that are more resilient → thus if we change environment, those may remain
- No inflammation tend to have more vulnerable taxa
- Do Kruskal Wallis then Tukey Post Hoc.
- Can group and do comparison: group A (HC & no inflammation no surgery) is significantly different from group B (the rest)
*Slide 7:* Change slide title to: something to do with how inflammation confounds CD
- Inflammation confounds effects of Crohn’s disease → When inflammation is separated into yes/no, effects are less profound
*Slide 9:" Healthy control is always coloured because always present. For the rest of the groups, significant groups are coloured
- g__uncultured --> should resolve after we add family name
- Don't make figure legend until figure is finalized
- Maybe highlight some key indicator species to talk about
*Slide 10:* Make conclusion less length moreso bullet points 
*Slide 11:* Split Future Directions into two slides
