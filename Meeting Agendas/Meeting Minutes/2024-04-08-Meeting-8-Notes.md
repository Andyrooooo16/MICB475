**Slide Deck for Presentation**: 
*Slide 5: Research Aims*
- Change the aim descriptions
- Aim 1: How does inflammation and surgical resection affect microbial diversity in Crohn's Disease patients?
- Aim 2: How does Crohn's Disease severity affect microbial diversity?
- Aim 3: What is the impact of surgery and inflammation on microbial composition within Crohn’s Disease patients?
- Research question: Can add severity to question but only if it's short and smooth still
- Is inflammation associated with the microbiome composition in Crohn's disease patients with or without surgical resection, and is this dependent on disease severity?

*Slide 7: Core Microbiome*
- Focus on richness aspect but make it sound different enough from alpha diversity title
- No inflammation or surgery is associated with a richer core microbiome
- A rich core microbiome is observed in Crohn's Disease patients with no inflammation or surgery

*Slide 9: Inflammation confounds effect on alpha diversity in Crohn’s Disease patients*
- change title, i.e. like how inflammation confounds CD and elaborate on effect
- reflect low medium high severity in title
- Reword results to: More severe disease is (significantly) associated with reduced (alpha) diversity in patients with no inflammation. This observation is confounded in patients with inflammation.

*Slide 10: ISA*
- change title: Anti-inflammatory bacteria are not observed in CD patients with surgery (something like this), Surgery correlates with reduced anti-inflammatory species...Can name drop faecali and roseburia
- What do colours mean?
purple --> indicator in HC
teal --> not in no inf + surgery
green --> not found in inf + surg
pink --> in HC and no inflammation groups

Larger grey dots --> outliers

*Slide 11: Conclusions*
- Phrase things a bit more biologically

*Slide 12: Future Directions*
- Simplify to 3 future directions
